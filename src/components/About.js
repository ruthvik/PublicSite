           âInitially when I joined the school, I thought of  learning Ninjutsu as a form of self defense only. But as I get exposed more to this art, I am really amazed how Ninjutsu has transformed me both physically and mentally. Learning the art of Taijutsu not only improved my self-confidence, it also helped in enforcing my self-discipline which is important in life. The diversity of Ninjutsu and Nachumâs fun way of teaching definitely have me looking forward to each and every lesson.â -Lawrence, 26
âForget about pop culture mythos and plunge into the reality of a millennium-old art. Ninjutsu is old and history-laden but itâs not ancient: itâs very much alive, will make you feel alive and, ultimately, may keep you alive. A martial art in its true sense, it will not only provide you with bone-crushing skills, it will train your body and your spirit, give you focus, a way to follow for a lifetime. Each of Nachumâs lessons is also a life lesson, and his teaching instills values such as self-discipline, persistence and humility without sacrificing the fun and friendly spirit.â
â Max, 34
âI love the profound logic behind every technique an the emphasis on natural body movement. It seems effortless but is very effective. Besides teaching us to defend ourselves, Nachum instills a sense of self worth in us. In three years, taijutsu has gone from being just a martial art into a way of life that has impacted me physically, emotionally and spiritually.â
â Hui Wen, 24, student
âTaijutsu is huge. It includes so many things and Nachum, with his free-flow teaching, really manages to bring us taijutsu in a living formâ¦ taijutsu teaches us to persist and adapt, two skills that are useful in all aspects of our lives. It can certainly enrich our way of living.â
â Felicia, 25
âI signed up for a trial and was hooked. Classes are conducted in a fun yet focused manner, starting from the basics and gradually building up to more advanced techniques. Shidoshi Nachum is a fantastic teacher and uses every opportunity to impart his knowledge in an authentic and safe manner. Trainings are very hands-on and he makes you want to learn more. I find the training to be empowering as it has helped me to develop calmness and an awareness of situations. This has been extremely useful especially when I am on business travel or travelling with my familyâ¦ very re-assuring and will give you some peace of mind and an invigorated spirit.â
â Shaun, corporate security profession with a US multinational.
âClasses at Singapore Ninjutsu are taught in a fun and inviting atmosphere. It is clear Nachum loves the art and enjoys sharing ninjutsu with his students.  His teaching style strikes the right balance between encouragement and not accepting âgood enough.â  It was a great decision to start my martial arts journey with Nachum and Singapore Ninjutsuâ â Graham.
âClasses with Nachum are fun and encouraging. Besides learning to defend myself, learning Taijutsu had provided me with a heightened sense of awareness and an ability to keep calm. Nachum is patient in explaining the principles in the techniques and is eager and enthusiastic in sharing his knowledge. Overall, it is a great experience.â â Markus
 âNinjutsu helps to train the body, focus the mind, and enriches the soul. Nachum is a patient, knowledgeable and friendly instructor, and I always look forward to training each week.â â Rusydi
âI had always been interested in learning a Japanese martial art and Singapore Ninjutsu happened to be the perfect opportunity to try my hand at it. Training with Nachum has been a great experience since he is patient and fun around his students and encourages us throughout, inculcating in us a sense of self and motivation. The lessons are technique â driven and have a real world application too. Eg. Itâs interesting to learn to defeat a stronger opponent through only a few calm calculated movements or to fall to the ground without injuring any bodyparts. Overall, I would recommend Singapore Ninjutusu to anyone who wants to learn a special skillset to hone his/her mind, body and soul.â â Swapna 
âI have been always interested in martial arts and was lucky to find the one I love on my first try. Even after a long tiring day, the training in the evening will no doubt energize me and I always go home with a satisfied and joyful spirit. Nachum is very patient and experienced with students. He teaches with detailed demonstration and clear explanation. Also, students are given plenty of time trying out the skills in pairs. For me, Ninjutsu is a perfect combination of fun and challenge. It teaches much more than you expect, the practice of courage, respect, wisdom and discipline.â â Yifei</p>
